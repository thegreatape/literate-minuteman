 Literate Minuteman is a free service to check your [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com) to-read list against the databases of the [Massachusetts Minuteman Library Network](http://www.mln.lib.ma.us/). It's very early in its development, having grown out of a set of scripts for my own personal use. Sign up and use it at [Literate Minuteman](http://minuteman.zen-hacking.com/)!
